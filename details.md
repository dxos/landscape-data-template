# DXOS

The new standard for building collaborative local-first software.

DXOS is an open source framework for building real-time, collaborative web applications that run entirely on the client and communicate peer-to-peer, without the need for centralized servers.

To show off the power of DXOS, we've built [Composer](https://dxos.org/composer). A local-first workspace that is designed for small team collaboration.

## Features

- **Client-side databases that scale**: ECHO is an open source database architecture that incorporates transparent data replication and conflict resolution for secure and scalable local storage.
- **Seamless Public/Private key identities**: HALO seamlessly manages digital identities using public/private key pairs allowing nuanced control over access to applications, databases, and networked devices.
- **Performant Peer-to-Peer networks**: MESH extends existing internet protocols to enable secure and resilient peer-to-peer networks without the need for centralized server infrastructure.
- **Seamless Collaboration**: Add realtime collaboration to your local-first application without the complexity of building your own sync engine.
